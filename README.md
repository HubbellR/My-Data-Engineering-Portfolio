# My-Data-Engineering-Portfolio
This is a collection of project repositories which demonstrate my proficiency with data engineering concepts by documenting my data engineering projects. Below are links to my Data Engineering portolion project repositories within Github.

## 1.  Kafka Stock Market Streaming Project 
   
   --> https://github.com/HubbellR/Kafka_Stock_Market_Streaming_Project
<br />

The purpose of this Kafka stock market streaming project is to illustrate how one could create a full end to end streaming solution using a simulated streaming input API, a Kafka runtime running on am AWS EC2 server,
S3 storage buckets, AWS Glue, and AWS Athena, so that this data stream can be indefintely stored and queried using SQL using minimal overhead.

## 2. Data Engineering Power BI Databricks Data Factory Project 

--> https://github.com/HubbellR/Data_Engineering_Power_BI_Databricks_Data_Factory_Project

This end to end data engineering project starts with a source CSV file which is then loaded into a MS sql server database. The database is then migrated to a data factory self-hosted instance. From here, a databricks cluster aggregates data. It is imported from the cluster to power BI where table is used to make an interactive dashboard.


## 3. Airflow Fill ETL Pipeline Using Snowflake Analyze Realestate Price Data
  
   --> https://github.com/HubbellR/Airflow_Fill_ETL_Pipeline_Using_Snowflake_Analyze_Realestate_Price_Data 


   This project is a full ETL Pipeline which goes from public realestate pricing data (from RedFin) to a fully analyzed product using Apache Airflow and Snowflake within an AWS server. For further details, please see readme file.
   
## 4. Azure Data Factory Real Time Employee Department Aggregation

--> https://github.com/HubbellR/Azure_Data_Factory_Real_Time_Employee_Department_Aggregation
   
The purpose of this project is to take two .json sources of employee.json and department.json, and ultimately convert these sources into a joined .csv file incorporating both employee and deprtment data.

## 6. Power BI HR Employee Satisfaction Attrition Dashboard

--> https://github.com/HubbellR/Power_BI_HR_Employee_Satisfaction_Attrition_Dashboard

This is a Power BI Dashboard build to help HR Track the omployee attrition, job satisfaction, employee age distribution, and education distribution.
 
## 7. Power BI Patient Statistics Display
  --> https://github.com/HubbellR/Power_BI_Patient_Statistics_Display

 This is a Power BI dashboard illustrating inpatient and outpatient data to illustrate various aspects of a real world patient wait list.

## 8. Amazon Data Scraping General Purpose Project

   --> https://github.com/HubbellR/Amazon_Data_Scraping_General_Purpose

Here is an example of a web scraping script I wrote to get pricing data from amazon shopping web pages.


## 9. Power BI Visualization Employee poll Results
   --> https://github.com/HubbellR/Power_BI_Visualization_W_Employee_poll_results

This is a Power BI visualization of a poll taken internally which helped project managers understand the internal pay for Data Professionals.
