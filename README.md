# My-Data-Engineering-Portfolio
This is a collection of project directories which demonstrate my proficiency with data engineering concepts by documenting my data engineering projects. Below are links to my Data Engineering portolion project repositories within Github.

1. --> https://github.com/HubbellR/Kafka_Stock_Market_Streaming_Project
<br />

The purpose of this Kafka stock market streaming project is to illustrate how one could create a full end to end streaming solution using a simulated streaming input API, a Kafka runtime running on am AWS EC2 server,
S3 storage buckets, AWS Glue, and AWS Athena, so that this data stream can be indefintely stored and queried using SQL using minimal overhead.

<br />
2. --> https://github.com/HubbellR/Data_Engineering_Power_BI_Databricks_Data_Factory_Project
   <br />
This end to end data engineering project starts with a source CSV file which is then loaded into a MS sql server database. The database is then migrated to a data factory self-hosted instance. From here, a databricks cluster aggregates data. It is imported from the cluster to power BI where table is used to make an interactive dashboard.

<br />
3. --> https://github.com/HubbellR/Airflow_Fill_ETL_Pipeline_Using_Snowflake_Analyze_Realestate_Price_Data 
   <br />

   This project is a full ETL Pipeline which goes from public realestate pricing data (from RedFin) to a fully analyzed product using Apache Airflow and Snowflake within an AWS server. For further details, please see readme file.
<br />
4. --> https://github.com/HubbellR/Azure_Data_Factory_Real_Time_Employee_Department_Aggregation
 <br />
The purpose of this project is to take two .json sources of employee.json and department.json, and ultimately convert these sources into a joined .csv file incorporating both employee and deprtment data.
<br />
5.  --> https://github.com/HubbellR/Power_BI_HR_Employee_Satisfaction_Attrition_Dashboard
 <br />
This is a Power BI Dashboard build to help HR Track the omployee attrition, job satisfaction, employee age distribution, and education distribution.
 <br />
6. --> https://github.com/HubbellR/Power_BI_Patient_Statistics_Display
 <br />
 This is a Power BI dashboard illustrating inpatient and outpatient data to illustrate various aspects of a real world patient wait list.
<br />
7. --> https://github.com/HubbellR/Amazon_Data_Scraping_General_Purpose
 <br />
Here is an example of a web scraping script I wrote to get pricing data from amazon shopping web pages.

<br />
9.  --> https://github.com/HubbellR/Power_BI_Visualization_W_Employee_poll_results

This is a Power BI visualization of a poll taken internally which helped project managers understand the internal pay for Data Professionals.
